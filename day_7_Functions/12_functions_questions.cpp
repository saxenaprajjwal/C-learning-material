// (Assignment Questions)

// Question 1 : Write a function to check if a number is a palindrome in C++. (121 is a palindrome, 321 is not)
// A number is called a palindrome if the number is equal to the reverse of a number.
// Eg : 121 is a palindrome because the reverse of 121 is 121 itself. On the other hand, 321 is 
//not a palindrome because the reverse of 321 is 123, which is not equal to 321.



// Question 2 : Write a function to calculate the sum of digits of a number.



// Question 3 : Write a function which takes 2 numbers as parameters (a & b) and outputs : a^2 + b^2 + 2*ab.





// Question 4 : Write a function that prints the largest of 3 numbers.



// Question 5 : Write a function that accepts a character (ch) as parameters & returns the character that occurs after ch in the English alphabet.
// Eg : input = ‘c’, return value = ‘d’
// Note : for ch = ‘z’, return ‘a’.
