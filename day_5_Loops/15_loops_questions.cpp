// (Assignment Questions)
// Question 1 : WAP to find the Factorial of a number entered by the user.
// Hint : factorial of a number (n) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ........... * 1 and exists for positive numbers only. We write factorial as n!
// So, factorial of 0! = 1, 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24 and so on.
// Note - Please do not confuse factorial with NOT EQUAL TO operator, they are not the same.





// Question 2 : WAP to print the multiplication table of a number, entered by the user.






// Question 3 : WAP to input a number and check whether the number is an Armstrong
// number or not.
// An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.





// Question 4 : For a positive N , WAP that prints all the prime numbers from 2 to N. (Assume N >= 2)



// Question 5 : For a positive N , WAP that prints the first N Fibonacci numbers. (Assume N >= 2)
// Fibonacci series : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 â€¦.
// This is a series where each number is a sum of previous 2 numbers in the series. Eg : 1 = 0 + 1,
// 2 = 1 + 1,
// 3 = 1 + 2,
// 5 = 2 + 3,
// 8 = 3 + 5 & so on.
